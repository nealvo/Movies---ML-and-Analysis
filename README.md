## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide users with movie recommendations based on their preferences. The system analyzes a dataset containing information about movies, such as genre, score, and user ratings, to generate personalized recommendations.

## Data Exploration

Explore the dataset to gain insights into movie ratings, scores, genres, and other relevant information. Visualizations are included to provide a better understanding of the data distribution.

## Data Cleaning

Handle missing values, outliers, and perform necessary data cleaning procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the recommendation system.

## Statistic Analysis

Conduct statistical analysis to derive meaningful insights from the dataset. This may include descriptive statistics, group statistics by genre or country, and hypothesis testing.

## Machine Learning - Recommendation

Implement a movie recommendation system using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. Users can input their favorite movie, and the system will suggest similar movies based on the algorithm's analysis.

## Usage

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Install the required dependencies.
    Run the recommendation system script.
    Enter your favorite movie when prompted.
    Receive personalized movie recommendations.

## Dependencies

    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Scikit-learn
    Tkinter (for GUI)
    Surprise (for collaborative filtering)

## Install dependencies using the following command:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
